# 42-Projects
This repository gathers my first projects developed at 42

- **[Libft](https://github.com/Grizzik/42-Projects/tree/main/Libft)** → A personal library reimplementing standard functions and adding new ones.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- **[ft_printf](https://github.com/Grizzik/42-Projects/tree/main/ft_printf)** → A recreation of `printf`, handling multiple conversions and formatting options.

- **[get_next_line](https://github.com/Grizzik/42-Projects/tree/main/gnl)** → An efficient function to read a file line by line, managing buffers and memory.

- **[Born2beroot](https://github.com/Grizzik/42-Projects/tree/main/born2beroot)** → An introductory project to system administration on Linux. It consists of creating and configuring a secure virtual machine by installing a minimal distribution (Debian). The goal is to learn the basics of user and group management, partitions, firewall configuration, as well as setting up security rules and essential services.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- **[push_swap](https://github.com/Grizzik/42-Projects/tree/main/push_swap)** → A sorting algorithm project where the goal is to sort a stack of integers using a limited set of stack operations. The challenge is to design the most efficient algorithm in terms of number of moves.

- **[pipex](https://github.com/Grizzik/42-Projects/tree/main/pipex)** → A project that recreates the behavior of shell pipes (`|`). It consists of executing multiple commands connected through pipes, managing processes, file descriptors, and environment variables.

- **[so_long](https://github.com/Grizzik/42-Projects/tree/main/so_long)** → A small 2D game built with the MiniLibX library. The objective is to collect items, avoid traps, and reach the exit. This project introduces graphics programming, event handling, and game loop design.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- **[Philosophers](https://github.com/Grizzik/42-Projects/tree/main/philosophers)** → A project based on the classic Dining Philosophers problem. The goal is to explore multithreading and synchronization by managing philosophers who alternate between eating, thinking, and sleeping, while avoiding deadlocks and race conditions.

- **[Minishell](https://github.com/Grizzik/42-Projects/tree/main/minishell)** → A simplified version of a Unix shell, developed in C. It implements features such as parsing, command execution, pipes, redirections, and environment variable management, while respecting shell behavior.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- **[Cub3D](https://github.com/Grizzik/42-Projects/tree/main/cub3d)** → A 3D game inspired by Wolfenstein 3D, using raycasting to render a first-person view inside a maze. This project focuses on graphics programming, vector math, player movement, and event handling with the MiniLibX library.

- **[CPP Module 00-04](https://github.com/Grizzik/42-Projects/tree/main/cpp)**
    - **[CPP Module 00]** → Introduction to C++ with the basics of syntax, namespaces, classes, member functions, and I/O streams.
      
    - **[CPP Module 01]** → Covers memory allocation, pointers and references, file streams, and the basics of dynamic memory management in C++.

    - **[CPP Module 02]** → Focuses on ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading, and Orthodox Canonical Form.

    - **[CPP Module 03]** → Introduces inheritance, the concept of base/derived classes, and proper use of constructors/destructors.

    - **[CPP Module 04]** → Explores subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces, and deeper use of inheritance in C++.
