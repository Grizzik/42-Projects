# 42-Projects
This repository gathers my first projects developed at 42

- **[Libft](https://github.com/Grizzik/42-Projects/tree/main/Libft)** → A personal library reimplementing standard functions and adding new ones.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- **[ft_printf](https://github.com/Grizzik/42-Projects/tree/main/ft_printf)** → A recreation of `printf`, handling multiple conversions and formatting options.

- **[get_next_line](https://github.com/Grizzik/42-Projects/tree/main/gnl)** → An efficient function to read a file line by line, managing buffers and memory.  

- **[Born2beroot](https://github.com/Grizzik/42-Projects/tree/main/born2beroot)** → An introductory project to system administration on Linux. It consists of creating and configuring a secure virtual machine by installing a minimal distribution (Debian). The goal is to learn the basics of user and group management, partitions, firewall configuration, as well as setting up security rules and essential services.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- **[push_swap](https://github.com/Grizzik/42-Projects/tree/main/push_swap)** → A sorting algorithm project where the goal is to sort a stack of integers using a limited set of stack operations. The challenge is to design the most efficient algorithm in terms of number of moves.  

- **[pipex](https://github.com/Grizzik/42-Projects/tree/main/pipex)** → A project that recreates the behavior of shell pipes (`|`). It consists of executing multiple commands connected through pipes, managing processes, file descriptors, and environment variables.  

- **[so_long](https://github.com/Grizzik/42-Projects/tree/main/so_long)** → A small 2D game built with the MiniLibX library. The objective is to collect items, avoid traps, and reach the exit. This project introduces graphics programming, event handling, and game loop design.
