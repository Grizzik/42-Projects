# 42-Projects
This repository gathers my first projects developed at 42

- **[Libft](https://github.com/Grizzik/42-Projects/tree/main/Libft)** → A personal library reimplementing standard functions and adding new ones.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- **[ft_printf](https://github.com/Grizzik/42-Projects/tree/main/ft_printf)** → A recreation of `printf`, handling multiple conversions and formatting options.

- **[get_next_line](https://github.com/Grizzik/42-Projects/tree/main/gnl)** → An efficient function to read a file line by line, managing buffers and memory.

- **[Born2beroot](https://github.com/Grizzik/42-Projects/tree/main/born2beroot)** → An introductory project to system administration on Linux. It consists of creating and configuring a secure virtual machine by installing a minimal distribution (Debian). The goal is to learn the basics of user and group management, partitions, firewall configuration, as well as setting up security rules and essential services.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- **[push_swap](https://github.com/Grizzik/42-Projects/tree/main/push_swap)** → A sorting algorithm project where the goal is to sort a stack of integers using a limited set of stack operations. The challenge is to design the most efficient algorithm in terms of number of moves.

- **[pipex](https://github.com/Grizzik/42-Projects/tree/main/pipex)** → A project that recreates the behavior of shell pipes (`|`). It consists of executing multiple commands connected through pipes, managing processes, file descriptors, and environment variables.

- **[so_long](https://github.com/Grizzik/42-Projects/tree/main/so_long)** → A small 2D game built with the MiniLibX library. The objective is to collect items, avoid traps, and reach the exit. This project introduces graphics programming, event handling, and game loop design.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- **[Philosophers](https://github.com/Grizzik/42-Projects/tree/main/philosophers)** → A project based on the classic Dining Philosophers problem. The goal is to explore multithreading and synchronization by managing philosophers who alternate between eating, thinking, and sleeping, while avoiding deadlocks and race conditions.

- **[Minishell](https://github.com/Grizzik/42-Projects/tree/main/minishell)** → A simplified version of a Unix shell, developed in C. It implements features such as parsing, command execution, pipes, redirections, and environment variable management, while respecting shell behavior.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- **[Cub3D](https://github.com/Grizzik/42-Projects/tree/main/cub3d)** → A 3D game inspired by Wolfenstein 3D, using raycasting to render a first-person view inside a maze. This project focuses on graphics programming, vector math, player movement, and event handling with the MiniLibX library.

- **[CPP Module 00-09](https://github.com/Grizzik/42-Projects/tree/main/cpp)**
    - **[CPP Module 00]** → Introduction to C++ with the basics of syntax, namespaces, classes, member functions, and I/O streams.
      
    - **[CPP Module 01]** → Covers memory allocation, pointers and references, file streams, and the basics of dynamic memory management in C++.

    - **[CPP Module 02]** → Focuses on ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading, and Orthodox Canonical Form.

    - **[CPP Module 03]** → Introduces inheritance, the concept of base/derived classes, and proper use of constructors/destructors.

    - **[CPP Module 04]** → Explores subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces, and deeper use of inheritance in C++.
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    - **[CPP Module 05]** → Introduction to exceptions in C++, including error handling with try/catch blocks, custom exception classes, and understanding their role in robust programs.

    - **[CPP Module 06]** → Covers casting in C++ (static_cast, dynamic_cast, reinterpret_cast, const_cast), their use cases, and type conversion best practices.

    - **[CPP Module 07]** → Focuses on templates in C++, creating generic functions and classes, and understanding how to write reusable and type-safe code.

    - **[CPP Module 08]** → Introduces the Standard Template Library (STL), including containers (vector, list, map, etc.), iterators, and algorithms for efficient data manipulation.

    - **[CPP Module 09]** → Explores advanced use of containers and algorithms, implementing custom containers, and deepening understanding of time complexity and algorithmic efficiency.

- **[ft_irc](https://github.com/Grizzik/42-Projects/tree/main/ft_irc)** → An IRC server implementation in C++98. It handles multiple clients, channels, authentication, and basic IRC commands while respecting the official RFC specifications. Worked with IRSSI, with [Afontain](https://github.com/AurelienFontaine) & [Bsalort](https://github.com/Kwro91)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- **[ft_transcendence](https://github.com/Grizzik/42-Projects/tree/main/ft_transcendence)** → A full-stack web application built with modern technologies (Fastify, Node.js, SQlite, Tailwind CSS, Docker). The project consists of creating an online Pong game with user authentication, chat, friends system, matchmaking, and real-time gameplay. It emphasizes web development, security, and deployment practices.
