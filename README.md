# 42-Projects
This repository gathers my first projects developed at 42.

- **Libft** is a personal library that reimplements standard functions and adds new ones, serving as a foundation for later projects.


- **ft_printf** recreates the behavior of the printf function, supporting multiple conversions and formatting options.


- **get_next_line** provides an efficient solution to read a file or input line by line, handling buffers and optimizing memory usage.
